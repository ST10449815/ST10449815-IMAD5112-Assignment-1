REPORT: 

The purpose of the app is to help Hera decide what to eat on busy days based on the time of the day. 

 In my app, I had used buttons, text views and plain texts. 
 I had used a text view for the heading of the app and to display the results when the user enters the time of the day.
 I used a plain text for the user to enter a time of day.
 A “suggest meal” and “clear” button was used to display the meal when the time of day is entered and the clear button is used to clear the input field and result. 
 I had used “if” statements to determine which meals to suggest.
 I added color to the background and buttons of the app and changed the fonts to ensure the app looked more appealing.
